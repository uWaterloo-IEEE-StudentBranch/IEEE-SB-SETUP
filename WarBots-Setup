    generally, you run the following commands in each folder:
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
    *Note* if configure gives errors on missing libraries, install them with synpatic and retry
    *Note* sudo make install is only for the libraries (libbats and librcsc)
    *Note* agent2d is dependent on librcsc, so install librcsc first
